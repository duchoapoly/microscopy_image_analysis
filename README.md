# Microscopy image processing and analysis 
This project composed of both processing and analysis steps on microscopy images. \
It addressed many aspects of a typical experiment with microscopy imaging (see 'question.pdf').  \
The first stage is to design a fluorescence microscopy experiment: select fluorophores, filter set, set up imaging conditions,... \
Then, the process of generated images using various algorithms which are provided by ImageJ tool (see 'report.pdf'): \
background subtraction, spatial filtering, Foruier filtering ... \
Next, the analysis of image quality via metrics like signal to background ratio, contrast sensitivity coefficient. \
Finally, the functional analysis of biological organelles via Kymograph.
